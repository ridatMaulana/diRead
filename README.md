## About Our App
>diRead is an innovative application designed to make it easier for users to explore and search for journals in various categories. This application offers a variety of features to enhance the reading experience and understanding of journal content.
>This application is a journal repository created to help make it easier to search for journals as references in writing scientific papers. This application is equipped with a search engine feature so that you can use the search engine to help search for journals. This application can also display journal articles.
### 1. Background
>The digital book and journals market has exploded with a plethora of options, making it challenging for readers to find books and journals that align with their unique tastes. Existing books and journals recommendation systems often fall short in delivering personalized suggestions. diRead seeks to bridge this gap by utilizing machine learning algorithms to understand user preferences and offer books and journals recommendations tailored to each individual.
### 2. Reason
>This application is designed to address the issues that hinder students from starting to write academic works, caused by several factors such as limited library access, lack of knowledge in finding good reference sources on the internet, and insufficient command of vocabulary and grammar.
And This application is designed to help individuals in finding and analyzing the sources of information they need, as well as conducting literature reviews.
### 3. Existing Result
>While there have been some efforts to improve book and journal recommendation systems, there is still a lack of comprehensive solutions that address the specific challenges faced by students and individuals in accessing relevant academic sources.
### 4. Implementation/Improvement & Reasoning
>Our team is working on implementing machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences based on historical data and user interactions. This will enable diRead to provide more accurate and personalized book and journal recommendations. We chose this approach because it allows for continuous learning and adaptation to changing user preferences.
